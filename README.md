# Testcases_CompilerConstruction16-17

Since the testcases are not part of the solution, we are allowed to share them (Our tutor confirmed this).

There are two rules I'd as you to follow:

1. Do never share code that is part of your solution. Also, please don't include comments that give away inner workings of your solution.
2. If you'd like to contribute testcases, contact me and I will give you write permission.

The filestructure is like this:

root

  *-- exercise1
  
    *-- <your name or synonym>
    
      *-- ok-cases
      
      *-- fail-cases

Happy CompilerConstruction-lecture together:)
